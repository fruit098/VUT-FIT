# VUT-FIT
Aim of this repository is to show some of projects done during my master studies on the [VUT FIT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en).
Each name of the folder is the name of school course and contains the more descriptive README or documentation in PDF format as well as solution in given language/framework. Names of courses and brief aim of projects done in specific course are explained per line below. 
Links in courses names will take you to the official course card website.
Not all of the courses/projects are listed here, I will update the repository given the time and motivation :D 

[UPA](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/225099/.en) - Data Storage and Preparation - Load raw data into NoSQL database then process, clean, aggregate those data into SQL database and create visualisations based on data in relation database.

[BDA](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/246392/.en) - Blockchain and Decentralised Applications - Creating custom crawler to collect all nodes in Znodes P2P network.
